       "7. </span>Further, there is no way of explaining how a Monad can be altered in quality or internally changed by any other created thing; since it is impossible to change the place of anything in it or to conceive in it any internal motion which could be produced, directed, increased or diminished therein, although all this is possible in the case of compounds, in which there are changes among the parts. The <span style=\"background-color: #efef7f\">Monads have no </span>windows<span style=\"background-color: #7fef7f\">window</span><span style=\"background-color: #efef7f\">, through which anything could come in or go out. </span>Accidents cannot separate themselves from substances nor go about outside of them, as the 'sensible species' of the Scholastics used to do. Thus <span style=\"background-color: #efef7f\">neither substance nor accident can come into a Monad from outside.</span><br></br><span style=\"background-color: #7fef7f\"><br> </br></span><span style=\"background-color: #efef7f\">\n",

       "8. Yet </span>the <span style=\"background-color: #efef7f\">Monads must have some qualities, otherwise they would not </span>even be existing things. And if simple substances did not differ in quality, there would be absolutely no means of perceiving any change in things. For what is in the compound can come only from the simple elements it contains, and the Monads, if they had no qualities, would be indistinguishable from one another, since they do not differ in quantity. Consequently, space being a plenum, each part of space would always receive, in any motion, exactly the equivalent of what it already had, and no one state of things would be discernible from another<span style=\"background-color: #7fef7f\">exist</span><span style=\"background-color: #efef7f\">.</span><br></br><span style=\"background-color: #7fef7f\"><br> </br></span><span style=\"background-color: #efef7f\">\n",

       "9.</span> Indeed,<span style=\"background-color: #efef7f\"> each Monad must be different from every other. For in nature there are never two beings </span>which are <span style=\"background-color: #efef7f\">perfectly alike </span>and in which it is not possible to find an internal difference, or at least a difference founded upon an intrinsic quality [denomination].<br></br><span style=\"background-color: #7fef7f\">. <br> </br></span><span style=\"background-color: #efef7f\">\n",

It is not as regards their object, but as regards the different ways in which they have knowledge of their object, that the Monads are limited. In a confused way they all strive after [vont a] the infinite, the whole; but they are limited and differentiated through the degrees of their distinct perceptions.<br></br><span style=\"background-color: #7fef7f\"><br> </br></span><span style=\"background-color: #efef7f\">\n",

For <span style=\"background-color: #efef7f\">all is a plenum (and thus all matter is connected together) and in the plenum every motion has an effect upon distant bodies in proportion to their distance, so that each body not only is affected by those which are in contact with it and in some way feels the effect of everything that happens to them, but also is </span>mediately <span style=\"background-color: #efef7f\">affected by bodies adjoining </span>those with which it <span style=\"background-color: #efef7f\">itself </span>is in immediate contact.
