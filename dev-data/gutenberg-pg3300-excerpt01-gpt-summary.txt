The main improvements in labor productivity and skill come from the division of labor. This division is more apparent in small-scale manufactures catering to fewer people, where all workers can be seen in one workhouse. In contrast, large-scale manufactures, serving the broader needs of society, employ many workers in different branches, making the division of labor less visible.

The pin-making industry illustrates this well. In a highly divided labor system, each worker performs a specific task, vastly increasing productivity. For example, ten workers in a small pin factory can produce 48,000 pins a day, each effectively making 4,800 pins. Without such division, an individual worker might struggle to make even one pin a day.

In all arts and manufactures, the division of labor increases productivity. In advanced societies, labor division results in separate trades and professions, unlike in simpler societies where one person might perform many tasks. However, agriculture doesn't allow for as much labor division due to seasonal work variations, possibly explaining why agricultural productivity doesn't always match that of manufacturing. Wealthier nations typically excel in both agriculture and manufacturing, but their manufacturing superiority is more pronounced. While the agricultural output of rich countries is often higher, it's not disproportionately so compared to their manufacturing output.
