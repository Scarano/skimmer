WeWork may seek bankruptcy protection as rumors swirl that the office sharing company will file for
Chapter 11 protection. The company's stock was halted on Monday, and a WeWork spokesperson refused
to comment on the matter. Shares of WeWork have plummeted in value, from over $400 two years ago to
less than $1 on Monday. WeWork's aggressive expansion in its early years has led to financial
difficulties, including significant cuts to operating costs and rising revenue. Despite efforts to
turn the company around, WeWork has struggled in a commercial real estate market affected by rising
borrowing costs and changing dynamics for office workers who now work remotely. The company has
renegotiated nearly all of its leases and skipped hefty interest payments, but it remains uncertain
whether WeWork will seek bankruptcy protection.
