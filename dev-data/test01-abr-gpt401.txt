Trading in shares of WeWork was halted Monday amid bankruptcy rumors. Reports last week suggested a Chapter 11 filing could happen soon. WeWork, once valued at $47 billion, has seen its stock plummet from over $400 to under $1. The companyâ€™s rapid growth led to a failed public launch in 2019, the ousting of CEO Adam Neumann, and a SoftBank rescue. Despite cost cuts and increased revenue post-Neumann, WeWork struggles with high lease liabilities and a changed office market. Recently, it sought to renegotiate leases and missed interest payments, entering a forbearance agreement to delay default.
